#Excel Challenges

1. Download the "Sample Data.xslx" file from this GitHub repo.

2. Copy and paste the Program field from column C into column F. Use the [Text to Columns](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Split-names-by-using-the-Convert-Text-to-Columns-Wizard-2cd989db-2b1f-4d89-b17b-534250ff9905) wizard (under Data -> Data Tools -> Text to Columns) to split it into two columns, F and G.  
Hint: The delimiter should be whatever character separates the first column value from the second column value.
For instance:

C | ... | E | F
--- |
**Program** | ... | **Program Code** | **Major**
BM4.UNDL | ... | BM4 | UNDL

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
